## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of CreatorBrief AI seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **security@creatorbrief-ai.com**

Include the following information in your report:
- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Within 30 days (depending on complexity)

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report
2. **Investigation**: We'll investigate and validate the reported vulnerability
3. **Fix Development**: We'll develop and test a fix
4. **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate disclosure with you
5. **Credit**: We'll credit you in our security advisories (if desired)

## Security Measures

### API Security

- **Rate Limiting**: 10 requests per hour per IP/user
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Errors don't expose sensitive information
- **HTTPS Only**: All communications encrypted in transit

### Data Protection

- **No Data Storage**: We don't store user inputs or generated briefs
- **API Key Security**: API keys are stored as environment variables
- **Caching**: Cached responses are anonymized and expire after 1 hour
- **Logging**: No sensitive data is logged

### Infrastructure Security

- **Environment Isolation**: Separate environments for development/production
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular security scans of dependencies
- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege
- **Monitoring**: Security monitoring and alerting

## Security Best Practices for Users

### API Key Management

- **Keep Keys Secret**: Never commit API keys to version control
- **Use Environment Variables**: Store keys in environment variables
- **Rotate Regularly**: Rotate API keys periodically
- **Monitor Usage**: Monitor API key usage for anomalies

### Deployment Security

- **HTTPS Only**: Always use HTTPS in production
- **Environment Variables**: Use secure environment variable management
- **Access Control**: Implement proper access controls
- **Updates**: Keep dependencies updated

### Input Sanitization

- **Validate Inputs**: Always validate user inputs
- **Sanitize Data**: Sanitize data before processing
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement client-side rate limiting
- **Error Handling**: Handle errors gracefully

## Known Security Considerations

### AI Provider APIs

- **API Key Exposure**: Ensure API keys are not exposed in client-side code
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect AI provider rate limits
- **Content Filtering**: Be aware of content filtering by AI providers
- **Data Usage**: Understand how AI providers use your data

### Client-Side Security

- **XSS Prevention**: All user inputs are sanitized
- **CSRF Protection**: CSRF tokens implemented where needed
- **Content Security Policy**: CSP headers configured
- **Secure Headers**: Security headers implemented

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Coordinated Disclosure

We follow a coordinated disclosure policy:

1. **Private Disclosure**: Report vulnerabilities privately first
2. **Investigation Period**: Allow time for investigation and fix
3. **Public Disclosure**: Coordinate public disclosure timing
4. **Credit**: Provide appropriate credit to researchers

### Bug Bounty

Currently, we don't have a formal bug bounty program, but we:
- Acknowledge security researchers in our documentation
- Provide public credit for responsible disclosure
- Consider monetary rewards for critical vulnerabilities
